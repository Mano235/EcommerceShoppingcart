          <p>
           Petshop is online ecommerce website where you can buy products for your pets, and even you can book grooming services for your pet in few clicks.
             </p>
          <p class="dark">
 where you can find high-quality pet supplies, which helps your pet at every life-stage. We will help you choose the most appropriate dog food, supplements, treats, toys, dog accessories. 
 The reason why we are considered a reliable pet shop online is because we adore pet-owners and even more their lovely pets!

 </p>
 
 <p class="dark">
That's how many pets are surrendered to shelters each year because their owners can't keep them.

Shelters don't have the money or room to care for them. They already have 5 million strays and abused animals to take in each year.

And so, millions are euthanized.



 </p>
 
 <h2>Together, we'll keep dogs and cats from ever seeing the inside of a shelter, so they can love and be loved in new homes.

Saving lives. Unburdening shelters. Creating community to make a difference. That's our mission. That's what we want you to know about us.
        </h2>

We are determined that things don't have to be this way. Not in our 21st century, web-connected world. So we created Get Your Pet, an online community where people who can't keep their pets connect directly with people who want to adopt a pet.
